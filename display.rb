      \n\t- The #{'codebreaker'.gray.bold}
      \t- The #{'codemaker'.gray.bold}

      \nThe #{'codemaker'.gray.bold} makes the code, which is a
      sequence of four colors chosen from the following:
      \n#{'  1  '.bg_red} #{'  2  '.bg_green} #{'  3  '.bg_brown} #{'  4  '.bg_blue} #{'  5  '.bg_magenta} #{'  6  '.bg_cyan}
      \nAn example of a code:
      \n#{'  2  '.bg_green} #{'  4  '.bg_blue} #{'  6  '.bg_cyan} #{'  2  '.bg_green}
      \nAs you can see, there can be more than one of the same color.
      The #{'codebreaker'.gray.bold} attempts to guess the code in 12 or fewer turns.
      After each guess, clues will be given in the form of colors.
      \nðŸ”´ means you have one correct color in the correct position.
      \nâšª means you have one correct color in the wrong position.
